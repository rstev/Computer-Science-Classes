# Denison Computer Science Coding Examples

This repository will be an example of some of the coding projects and excersises we complete here at Denison University. The files included will consist of old projects and coding practices stidents could expect to see through classes the first two years. All files in this repository should only be used as an reference of one way to tackle some of the problems. This is not a location where people can simply copy work or code. Rather this should be used as an example of what we do here at Denison University, as well as a location where I can safely store work for access on a different multitude of machines.  

## Getting Started

Files are all accessible via Github. A request will need to be made to me, I will have to grant access in order for a pull to be possible. The way to access my files works as any other repository. Simply do a git clone, followed by a git pull in order to get a copy of all of the files in my repository. Once a pull has been made, simply navigate to the location where your files are stored through the terminal or a GUI. From there you will be able to access, test, and modify, several examples of code that I have worked on over the past few years. 

### Prerequisites

Most of the files in this repository are going to be in the form a C or C++ file. That being said, any text editor will be able to open and modify the coding examples that I am including. Some examples of text editors include ATOM, JEDIT, Notepad, Notepad++. 

Instructions for downloading ATOM can be found at - https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/
Instructions for downloading Jedit can be found at - www.jedit.org/index.php?page=download

Note - Notepad comes standard on most Windows machines so consult your application files because you may not need to install anything at all. 

## Running the tests

Once a text editing program has been downloaded/located, you will need to access terminal or CMD.exe in order to compile and run these test programs.
